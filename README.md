# MovieMania
I uploaded all the files and the database of the project
I didn't manage to finish due to electricity (my laptop turned off and had to move the project to another pc and connect to 4G to deploy to github)
3 hours are enough time to finish all task with a acceptable presentation. (electricity problem didn't allow to do that sorry !)

I could have done this in php


to launch the web site is from the login page, you don't have an account you can create one. (it's working)


There is some file (Jsp) are the same, in reality the difference is due to the path, 1 is for the Admin and 1 is for User (client)

the client have the admin field hidden, cause only the admin can define who is admin

the HomePage is basically the result of the search which you will find all the movies basically by default

you can add a movie (the admin can do that)

the update is only for the rating i didn't manage to finish it i only needed to set the page to modify the rate and put the value in the query (which the query is ready)

the delete i didn't manage to test it, you can delete or update from the search table (the homepage is where you can select, i create 2 columns which by selecting the button it takes you
to the correct page with the id of the movie and you can update or delete easuly


the login page work fine for the admin and user
adding a movie also 
the image is a link, that will upload in the display (the code is written but didn't have the time to test)
